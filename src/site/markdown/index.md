### Where to go next ?

* If you are interested into PS / PDF conversion or rendition have a look at the [High level API samples](highlevelapisamples.html).

* If you already know Ghostscript and want to perform advanced operations on documents, have a look at the [Core API samples](coreapisamples.html).

* If you plan to use Ghost4J in a highly concurrent environment (such as a web server), don't forget to read [Thread safety and multi-threading](threadsafetyandmultithreading.html).
